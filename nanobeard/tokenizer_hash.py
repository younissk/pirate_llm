"""Tokenizer fingerprint used to gate ckpt loading.

Silent tokenizer drift between training and inference is the single most
expensive bug class for tiny LMs — the model emits gibberish and nothing in
the loss / logs tells you why. Hashing the tokenizer file at train time and
re-checking at load time turns that into a loud failure.
