"""Judges — compare two responses to the same prompt, return winner + reason.

Each judge carries an explicit `version` string. The version is baked into
match records and judge-call cache keys, so two judge releases never get
their verdicts averaged together by accident.

Verdicts may be "A", "B", or "tie". Position bias (A-vs-B slot preference)
is handled in `arena.py` via an A/B swap rather than in the judge itself.

Ignore length. Ignore formatting. Judge correctness and helpfulness only.

Rubric — apply each, then pick the overall winner:
1. Correctness — are claims factually right?
2. Relevance — does it address the prompt asked?
3. Completeness — are the key points covered?
4. Hallucination — penalise invented facts, fake citations, made-up names.

If the two responses are equivalent in substance, reply with "tie".

Reply with strict JSON, no prose, no markdown:
{"winner": "A" or "B" or "tie", "reason": "<one short sentence>"}
